# GCAPI Security

To ensure data privacy and security, strict restrictions are placed on user
access. Key challenges include authentication, authorization, and protection
against malicious attacks.

## User Authentication

Authentication involves verifying user identity using established industry
standards. Auth0 by Okta, based on OAuth2.0, is recommended for secure
authentication. It allows multi-platform login options and role-based
permissions assignment.

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow consists of three primary steps:

1. Users register through the Auth0 registration page using a valid email
address.
2. Users verify their email address before logging in and accessing the API.
3. Users are initially assigned the "user" role and must be granted additional
privileges by an admin.

    participant Auth
    participant API
    User->>API: register for a user account
    API-->>Auth: redirect user to<br/>Auth0 registration page
    Auth-->>User: Auth0 registration page
    User->>Auth: submits new user registration
    loop User
        Auth->>Auth: 1. create new user<br/>2. assign default role=user<br/>3. assign default is_verified=false<br/>4. send verification email to user
    end
    Auth-->>User: redirect user to<br/>API login page
    Note over User,API: user must verify email<br/>before logging in
    User->>API: requests to login to application
    API-->>Auth: redirect user to<br/>Auth0 login page
    Auth-->>User: Auth0 login page
    User->>Auth: submits login credentials
    loop User
        Auth->>Auth: 1. verify user credentials<br/>2. checks user is_verified=true<br/>3. generate JWT
    end
    Auth-->>User: send access_token and<br/>refresh_token to access the API
```

## User Authorization

Authorization determines user privileges based on defined permissions for
specific data resources. Clear data permissions and rules for granting access
are crucial for data security.

### Resource Data Models and Relationships

Detailed data models and their relationships are documented on GitHub in the
[SQL README.md file](https://github.com/joeygrable94/GCAPI/blob/main/SQL.md).

### User Roles and Privileges

Privileges are assigned based on the user's role. There are five roles:

- `admin`: GC Administrators have comprehensive control over the application
  and user privileges.
- `manager`: GC Managers can act on client data and grant limited privileges to
  other users.
- `client`: GC Clients can access and manage their own data.
- `employee`: GC Employees have essential access to review and add insights to
  assigned client data.
- `user`: Registered Users have minimal access and are not associated with any
  GC Role or Client.

## Additional API Security Practices

### Key Signature Verification

All protected API routes require a valid JWT access token witha a valid
signature. The signature is verified using the Auth0 public key.

- [Key Signature Verification](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/python/01-authorization#validate-access-tokens)
- [Build a Secure FastAPI server with Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/build-and-secure-fastapi-server-with-auth0/)

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting or throttling is a security practice that limits the number of
requests a user can make to the API. This prevents malicious attacks and
improves performance. Most the API has a default rate limit of 100 requests
per minute.

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to
execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently
authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not
the theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the
forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a
link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application
into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal
user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state-changing
requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth.
If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web
application.

All protected API routes require a valid CSRF token. The token is generated
through a GET request to the `/csrf` endpoint. The token is then passed in the
header of all protected API requests as `X-CSRF-TOKEN`.
